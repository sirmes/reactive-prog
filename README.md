Experiments using reactive programming stuff.

The course is going great, content is amazing, dynamic and fun.

The content will increase in the next weeks, so wait before you fork this repo, since the course is in progress during November 2013 and December 2013.

Btw if you are taking the course, please don't look at the homeworks before you finish yours (no cheap!) otherwise you will not learn as much as you want!
